# FIFA 20 Player Analysis Case Study

## Abstract
This project aims to analyze a dataset derived from the FIFA 20 video game, focusing on professional football players' demographics, physical attributes, skill ratings, and market values. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover relationships among various factors, identify patterns, and provide insights that could impact team composition or player development. The analysis includes data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and its implications.

### Explanation
The abstract provides a high-level overview of the project, outlining its main objectives and the methods used to achieve them. It mentions the focus on player demographics, physical attributes, skill ratings, and market values, and highlights the use of EDA, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing a dataset derived from the popular video game FIFA 20. The dataset includes detailed information on professional football players, capturing aspects such as demographics, physical attributes, skill ratings, and market values. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships among various factors and identify patterns that could impact team composition or player development.

### Explanation
The introduction provides more context about the project, describing the dataset and its contents in detail. It reiterates the goal of performing EDA to uncover relationships and patterns that could influence team composition or player development.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main units:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
2. **Hypothesis Testing**
3. **Prediction and Feature Engineering**

### Explanation
This section outlines the structure of the project, breaking it down into three main units. Each unit represents a different phase of the analysis, from understanding and preprocessing the data to testing hypotheses and performing predictive modeling and feature engineering.

## Files
