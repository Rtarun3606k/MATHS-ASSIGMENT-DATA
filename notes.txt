To ensure that the provided code and analysis meet the criteria mentioned in the guidelines, let's break down the requirements and check if the code aligns with them. Additionally, I'll provide a README file for the project.

### Checking the Code Against the Guidelines

#### 1. Data Set
- **Criteria Matching**: Ensure the dataset meets the criteria mentioned in the guidelines.
- **Attributes and Rows**: Check the number of columns and rows.
- **Value Contribution**: Evaluate how much value the attributes contribute.
- **Missing Values**: Identify missing values and NaNs.
- **Categorical and Numerical Columns**: Identify the presence of categorical and numerical columns.

#### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Identification of Missing Data**: Identify missing data.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Replace missing values appropriately.
- **Methods for Missing Values**: Identify different methods for handling missing values.
- **Dropping Attributes**: Provide valid reasons if any attribute is dropped.

#### 3. Visualization
- **Appropriate Graphs**: Use appropriate graphs for visualization.
- **Ease of Visualization**: Ensure graphs are easy to interpret.
- **Graph Labels**: Include names for x-axis, y-axis, and title.
- **Legend**: Include a legend if required.
- **Axis Extension**: Extend the axis if required.

#### 4. Insights/Results
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform hypothesis testing and provide results.
- **Normalization**: Normalize the data if necessary.
- **Checking for Normality**: Check for normality.
- **Graph Conclusions**: Draw conclusions from graphs.
- **Accuracies**: Provide accuracies and reasons for them.

#### 5. Information Nugget
- **Key Information**: Identify key information specific to the dataset.

### Suggested Changes
- Ensure all steps are covered in the notebooks.
- Add comments and explanations for each step.
- Include appropriate visualizations with labels and legends.
- Provide detailed insights and conclusions.

# FIFA 20 Player Analysis Case Study

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing a dataset derived from the popular video game FIFA 20. The dataset includes detailed information on professional football players, capturing aspects such as demographics, physical attributes, skill ratings, and market values. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships among various factors and identify patterns that could impact team composition or player development.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three main units:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
2. **Hypothesis Testing**
3. **Prediction and Feature Engineering**

## Files
- `data_understanding_and_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data understanding and preprocessing tasks.
- `hypothesis_testing.ipynb`: Notebook for hypothesis testing tasks.
- `linear_regression_and_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Notebook for linear regression analysis and feature engineering tasks.
- `players_15.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `report.pdf`: A PDF report of the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. Refer to the `report.pdf` for detailed insights and conclusions.

## Data Understanding and Preprocessing

## Prediction and Feature Engineering
This notebook covers:
- Linear regression analysis using 'Age' and 'Potential' to predict 'Overall' ratings
- Feature engineering to enhance predictions

## Insights and Results
- Hypothesis testing results
- Normalization and checking for normality
- Graph conclusions and accuracies
- Key information specific to the dataset

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the FIFA 20 player dataset, uncovering valuable insights and patterns. The notebooks and report offer a detailed exploration of the data, ensuring the best outcomes for machine learning projects.
