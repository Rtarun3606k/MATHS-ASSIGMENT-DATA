# FIFA 20 Player Analysis Case Study

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing a dataset derived from the popular video game FIFA 20. The dataset includes detailed information on professional football players, capturing aspects such as demographics, physical attributes, skill ratings, and market values. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships among various factors and identify patterns that could impact team composition or player development.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main units:

1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
2. **Hypothesis Testing**
3. **Prediction and Feature Engineering**

## Files

- `data_understanding_and_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data understanding and preprocessing tasks.
- `hypothesis_testing.ipynb`: Notebook for hypothesis testing tasks.
- `linear_regression_and_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Notebook for linear regression analysis and feature engineering tasks.
- `players_15.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `report.pdf`: A PDF report of the analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```
````

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. Refer to the `report.pdf` for detailed insights and conclusions.

## Data Understanding and Preprocessing
